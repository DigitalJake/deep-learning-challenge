# Report

This analysis sought to create a neural network model to classify applicants seeking funding from a nonprofit foundation as likely to be successful or not.


Overall, the model reached its target accuracy of 73% after optimzation. Improvements to this model could be done with keras-tuner hyperparameter optimization or enhanced data cleaning. 

This problem and data may require a better ML model or more diverse data to reach a higher accuracy score.
